    <string name="chen">Sit facing the weight stack of an overhead lat pulldown machine with a wide bar attached. Reach overhead and grab the bar with a wide grip, palms facing away from your body. Lean back 30â€“45 degrees and pull the bar down toward your chest. Engage your latissimus dorsi, the large muscles down the sides of your back.</string>
<string name="wingsdetails">Although the lat pulldown is a wonderful back movement that certainly has its place, it can not replace the true back builders like chins, pullups, bent rows, seated pully rows, T-bar rows, dumbell rows, and deadlifts. Those that do not make these exercises the foundation of their back routine are not only narrow minded, but will always be narrow period!</string>
